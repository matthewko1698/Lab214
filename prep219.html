    <h2>Reduce Method: Mean</h2>
    <p id="mean"></p>
    <p>The reduce method works by taking an array and combining the numbers in the array
    into one number, however the user wants. The reduce method needs a function to process
    the numbers. This function is passed a "total" and a "number". The total is a variable that
  is kept as a placeholder for what the array is going to be combined into. The number is the specific number
in the array that the reduce method is at. The function that is passed to the reduce method, say a sum function will be
passed the total and the number of the array it is at, adding each specific number to the total until the method goes through
the whole array, when it then returns the sum. To get the mean, take the total and divide it by the length of the array. </p>
